# Recocloud ROSE

Reco One Stop Ecosystem

This system serve as a dialup book to navigate to our services. Due to the limited resources and we couldn't affor the price for DDNS in AWS, we didn't use any gateway to point to our service, this create the difficulty for user to remember the IPv4 number.

Hence, this page is here to access our cloud service such as Lane guard, L4, Insight API etc that deployed on AWS EC2.

To deploy this app, run `./script/app-deploy.sh`
